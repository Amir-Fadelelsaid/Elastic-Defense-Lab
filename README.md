# Elastic-Defense-Lab

## üìå Project Overview
Elastic-Defense-Lab is a **cybersecurity home lab** designed to simulate real-world **SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst** tasks. It leverages **AWS, Windows, Elastic SIEM, and Elastic Defend** to detect and respond to malware, providing hands-on experience in threat monitoring and incident response.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies Used
- **AWS EC2** ‚Äì Windows instance for endpoint monitoring
- **Elastic SIEM** ‚Äì Cloud-based security information and event management
- **Elastic Defend** ‚Äì Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solution
- **Windows Event Logs** ‚Äì Log collection for security analysis
- **PowerShell** ‚Äì Agent installation and configuration

## üöÄ Features
- Deploys a **Windows virtual machine** in AWS
- Installs **Elastic Defend** for endpoint monitoring
- Configures **Elastic SIEM** to collect and analyze logs
- Simulates **malware detection** using the EICAR test file
- Responds to threats **just like a SOC analyst**

## üèóÔ∏è Setup Instructions
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Windows Instance in AWS**
1. Create an **AWS account** ([AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)).
2. Launch a **Windows EC2 instance** using a free-tier eligible AMI.
3. Create and download an **RDP key pair** to access your instance.
4. Configure security groups to allow **RDP access (port 3389)**.
5. Connect to the instance using **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Elastic SIEM**
1. Sign up for an [Elastic SIEM Free Trial](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/elastic-siem).
2. Deploy an **Elastic Cloud instance**.
3. Enable **security analytics** and configure log ingestion.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Install & Configure Elastic Defend Agent**
1. In **Elastic SIEM**, go to **"Fleet"** ‚Üí **"Agents"**.
2. Click **"Add Agent"**, generate an installation script.
3. Run the script in PowerShell on the Windows VM.
4. Verify that logs are being ingested in **Elastic SIEM**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Simulate Malware Detection**
1. Download the [EICAR test file](https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950).
2. Attempt to execute it on the Windows VM.
3. Elastic Defend should detect and quarantine the file.
4. Review the alert in **Elastic SIEM** under the **Alerts tab**.

## üìä Use Cases & Learning Outcomes
‚úÖ Understand **SIEM architecture** and log ingestion  
‚úÖ Gain hands-on experience in **malware detection & response**  
‚úÖ Learn to configure **endpoint security agents**  
‚úÖ Practice **SOC analyst workflows** with **alert analysis & triage**  

## üì∏ Screenshots & Explanations
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ AWS EC2 Windows Instance
This screenshot shows the **AWS EC2 dashboard** with a **Windows instance running**. The instance is used to simulate an enterprise endpoint that is monitored for security threats.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
- üõ† **Automate deployment** using Terraform
- üîç **Expand to Linux/macOS agents** for cross-platform monitoring
- üìà **Create custom detection rules** in Elastic SIEM
- üîí **Integrate Splunk or other SIEM tools** for comparative analysis

## üèÜ Acknowledgments
Built as a hands-on cybersecurity project to simulate **real-world SOC workflows** and gain **practical experience** in threat detection & incident response. Inspired by **Elastic Security Labs** and AWS best practices.
